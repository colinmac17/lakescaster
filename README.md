# Lakescaster

Welcome to Lakescaster. I hope this application is helping you better understand surfing conditions on the Great Lakes as well as providing you the most optimal experience with checking the waves and planning your surf sessions.

## Purpose

An online and open-source application to check surfing conditions at various Great Lakes beaches. My goal is to build a community centric platform where you (the users) are the contributors to the application's success.

## Data

We are utilizing open-source data from the [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), specifically their [GLERL](https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/) (Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory).

## Get Involved

The more I get help from contributors, the faster the platform will grow. Please fork this repository and submit pull requests accordingly and I will review them as quickly as possible. If you have not already realized, I have built this app using the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) PHP and [React](https://reactjs.org) JS frameworks. 

## Desired Features
#### Users can...
- (TO DO) Check current and future surfing conditions at various Great Lake's surfing spots. Data points: Wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind velocity, wind direction and air temperature.
- (TO DO) Rate a surfing spot and view rankings of surf spots, both aggregately and by lake. 
- (TO DO) Post photos and videos of conditions while they are checking the surf
